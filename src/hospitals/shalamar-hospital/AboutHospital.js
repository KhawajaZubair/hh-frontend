      <h2>About Shalamar Hospital</h2>
      <h3>Shalamar Hospital</h3>
      <p>
        Shalamar Hospital was started in 1978 as a small 50-bed hospital that
        had just six outpatient departments. Over the last 40 years, the
        hospital has grown to ten times its size now holding 500 beds and 25
        different departments. The hospital also functions as a training center
        for young medical students and conducts an extensive amount of research
        into emerging fields of medicine. It is currently functioning as a
        non-profit hospital that is operating mainly on donations from the
        government and grants from private organisations.

      <p>
        The hospital started its dialysis center in 2003 and has since used to
        treat a very large number of patients, many of whom did not have to pay
        the hospital at all due to their financial status. The hospital also
        runs a special one-stop breast clinic that quickly and efficiently
        checks thousands of women for breast-related illnesses every month. They
        run these checks as non-invasively as possible so that there is minimal
        discomfort for the patients.
